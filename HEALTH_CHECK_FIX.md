# Health Check Failure Fix

## Issue Summary
Railway deployment was failing at the health check phase with the following error:
```
TypeError: 'generator' object is not an async iterator
ERROR: Application startup failed. Exiting.
```

## Root Cause
In `app/main.py`, the `lifespan` function was decorated with `@asynccontextmanager` but was defined as a regular function instead of an async function:

```python
# ❌ WRONG (caused the error)
@asynccontextmanager
def lifespan(_: FastAPI):
    init_db()
    yield
```

When FastAPI tried to use this lifespan context manager, it expected an async iterator but got a regular generator, causing a `TypeError` during application startup.

## The Fix
Changed the function signature from `def` to `async def`:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(_: FastAPI):
    init_db()
    yield
```

## Why This Matters
- **`@asynccontextmanager`** requires an **async function** to create an async context manager
- Without the `async` keyword, Python creates a regular generator
- FastAPI's lifespan handling expects an async context manager for proper startup/shutdown hooks
- This prevented the app from initializing, causing all health checks to fail

## Verification

### Local Test
```bash
python -c "from app.main import app; print('✅ App imports successfully!')"
# Output: ✅ App imports successfully!
```

### Expected Railway Behavior
After this fix:
1. ✅ Build completes (already working)
2. ✅ Container starts
3. ✅ **Application initializes** (previously failing here)
4. ✅ Health check at `/health` returns 200 OK
5. ✅ Deployment succeeds

## Deployment Timeline

| Event | Status | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| First deploy (build error) | ❌ Failed | 12:26 PM |
| Fixed `pyproject.toml` | ✅ Deployed | 12:31 PM |
| Build succeeded, health check failed | ❌ Failed | 12:34 PM |
| **Fixed lifespan async** | 🚀 **Deploying** | Now |

## What Changed

**File:** `app/main.py`  
**Line:** 12  
**Change:** Added `async` keyword  
**Commit:** `36d9b27`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Fixed and pushed** - Railway will auto-deploy
2. ⏳ **Wait ~2-3 minutes** for Railway to rebuild
3. ✅ **Verify health check passes**
4. ✅ **Initialize database** (if health check passes)
5. ✅ **Test API endpoints**

## Common Python Async Pattern

This is a common mistake when working with async context managers:

```python
# Regular context manager (synchronous)
@contextmanager
def my_context():
    # setup
    yield
    # teardown

# Async context manager (asynchronous)
@asynccontextmanager
async def my_async_context():  # ← Must be 'async def'
    # setup
    yield
    # teardown
```

**Key Rule:** `@asynccontextmanager` **always** requires `async def`.

**Status:** ✅ **Fixed and deployed**  
**Expected Result:** Health check should now pass! 🎉
