# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issue: Railway Build Failed (Sep 30, 2025)

### Error Message
```
error in 'egg_base' option: 'app' does not exist or is not a directory
```

### Root Cause
The `pyproject.toml` was configured with:
```toml
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["app"]
include = ["*"]
```

This told setuptools to look for packages **inside** the `app/` directory, but our package structure has `app` as the top-level package itself.

During Railway's Nixpacks build process:
1. Only `pyproject.toml` is copied first
2. `pip install .` tries to discover packages
3. Fails because `app/` directory doesn't exist yet in the build context

### Solution

**Changed `pyproject.toml`:**
```toml
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["."]
include = ["app*"]
```

This tells setuptools:
- Look in the current directory (`.`)
- Include packages matching `app*` pattern
- Works correctly when the full source is copied

**Added `.dockerignore`:**
- Excludes local artifacts (`.db`, `.venv/`, logs)
- Reduces build context size
- Speeds up builds

### Verification

✅ **Local test passed:**
```bash
pip install -e . --no-deps --force-reinstall
# Successfully installed pricebot-0.1.0
```

✅ **Pushed to GitHub:**
- Commit: `7dbe183`
- Railway will auto-deploy on push

## Expected Railway Build Flow (Fixed)

1. **Setup**: Install Python 3.12, gcc
2. **Install**: 
   ```bash
   python -m venv /opt/venv
   pip install --upgrade build setuptools
   pip install .  # ✅ Now works!
   ```
3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[ocr,pdf]
   ```
4. **Start**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → your project
   - Watch "Deployments" tab for new build
   - Should complete in ~2-3 minutes

2. **Once deployed**:
   ```bash
   # Get your Railway service URL from dashboard
   export RAILWAY_URL="https://web-production-cd557.up.railway.app"
   
   # Test health endpoint
   curl $RAILWAY_URL/health
   
   # Expected response:
   # {
   #   "status": "ok",
   #   "service": "Pricebot",
   #   "version": "0.1.0",
   #   "environment": "production"
   # }
   ```

3. **Initialize Database**:
   ```bash
   # Link to Railway project (if not done yet)
   cd /Users/AR180/Desktop/Codespace/pricebot
   railway link --project <your-project-id>
   
   # Initialize tables
   railway run python -c "from app.db.session import init_db; init_db()"
   ```

4. **Test API**:
   ```bash
   # View API docs
   open https://web-production-cd557.up.railway.app/docs
   
   # Test offers endpoint
   curl $RAILWAY_URL/offers?limit=5
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails

**Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs --build
```

**Common issues:**
1. **Missing README.md**: Ignore this warning, it's non-fatal
2. **Tesseract not found**: OCR features need system package (Railway should install via Nixpacks)
3. **Database connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL addon is linked

### If Health Check Fails

**Check deployment logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

**Verify environment variables:**
```bash
railway variables
```

**Required variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` (auto-set by Railway PostgreSQL)
- `PORT` (auto-set by Railway)

**Optional variables:**
- `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- `DEFAULT_CURRENCY=USD`

## Files Changed

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `pyproject.toml` | Fixed package discovery | Allows `pip install .` to work |
| `.dockerignore` | Added exclusions | Optimizes build size |
