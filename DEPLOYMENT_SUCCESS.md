## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions (You Can Do Now):**

1. **Upload Real Data**
   ```bash
   # Use the web interface at:
   https://web-production-cd557.up.railway.app/
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Get offers
   curl https://web-production-cd557.up.railway.app/offers
   
   # Get vendors
   curl https://web-production-cd557.up.railway.app/vendors
   ```

3. **Monitor Ingestion**
   - Visit: https://web-production-cd557.up.railway.app/admin/documents
   - Watch for processing status
   - Check extracted offers

### **Phase 2 Features (Future):**

- [ ] Email integration (forward@pricebot.com)
- [ ] WhatsApp Business API integration
- [ ] Advanced OCR for images/PDFs
- [ ] Price alert notifications
- [ ] Multi-user authentication
- [ ] Custom price rules
- [ ] Export reports (Excel, PDF)
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Webhook notifications

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

**Current Status:**
- ✅ HTTPS enabled (Railway SSL)
- ✅ Environment variables secured
- ✅ Database credentials in Railway secrets
- ⚠️ No authentication on endpoints (MVP)

**Phase 2 Security:**
- [ ] API key authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Input validation hardening
- [ ] File upload size limits
- [ ] Virus scanning

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **OCR Support**: Requires Tesseract installation on Railway
   - **Workaround**: Pre-process images locally or use API
   
2. **No Authentication**: All endpoints are public
   - **Risk**: Anyone can upload/query data
   - **Mitigation**: Add to Phase 2
   
3. **WhatsApp Integration**: Manual export only
   - **Current**: Export chat → upload text file
   - **Future**: Direct API integration

---

## 📊 Database Schema

**Tables Created:**
- `vendors` - Vendor information
- `products` - Product catalog
- `product_aliases` - Alternative product names
- `source_documents` - Uploaded files metadata
- `offers` - Price data
- `price_history` - Historical pricing
- `ingestion_jobs` - Processing status

**Relationships:**
- Products → Offers (one-to-many)
- Vendors → Offers (one-to-many)
- Documents → Offers (one-to-many)
- Products → Aliases (one-to-many)
