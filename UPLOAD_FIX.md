## 🚀 Production Stabilization – October 1, 2025

**Status:** ✅ Verified locally

### Issue
- Uploads returned 500s in production because PostgreSQL rejects timezone-aware timestamps on `source_documents.ingest_started_at`/`ingest_completed_at`.

### Fixes
- Normalize every ingestion timestamp to timezone-naive UTC before persistence (`app/db/models.py`, ingestion helpers, CLI entrypoint).
- Updated `/documents/upload` endpoint to use the shared helper so metadata commits succeed on PostgreSQL.
- Extended the upload flow test to assert naive timestamps for documents and offers to prevent regressions.

### Validation
- `python3 -m pytest`

---

## 🛠️ Regression Fix – October 10, 2025

**Status:** ✅ Verified locally

### Issue
- Uploads with unusual filenames triggered a 500 because the resolved storage path became `NULL`, breaking the `source_documents.storage_path` constraint.

### Fixes
- Sanitize incoming filenames and build a deterministic storage key before writing the file.
- Resolve storage directory to an absolute path and guard metadata commits with cleanup on failure.
- Capture persisted vendor IDs, enrich logging, and surface file metadata for debugging.
- Added `tests/test_upload_flow.py::test_upload_handles_weird_filename` to cover the regression.

### Validation
- `python3 -m pytest`

## 🔄 Regression Fix – October 8, 2025

**Status:** ✅ Verified end-to-end

### Issues Fixed
- Restored the upload UI by exporting `upload_router`, serving the page at `/upload`, and redirecting `/` requests to the UI instead of JSON metadata.
- Added structured logging inside `POST /documents/upload` so we can trace processor selection, file persistence, ingestion activity, and failure states.
- Extended the E2E coverage with `tests/test_upload_flow.py` to confirm uploads create source documents, vendors, offers, and write the file to storage.
- Hardened the frontend error handler to surface API errors gracefully when uploads fail downstream.

### Validation Steps
- `python3 -m pytest`
- Verified storage path exists and is writable (`app/core/config.py` ➜ `settings.ingestion_storage_dir`).
- Manual Test: `curl -F "file=@sample.csv" -F "vendor_name=CLI" http://localhost:8000/documents/upload` (returns success payload).

# Upload Interface Fix - RESOLVED ✅

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## 🐛 **Issues Found**

### **Issue #1: Upload Button Not Working**

**Problem:**
- File chooser dialog would not open when clicking "Choose Files" button
- Caused by conflicting click handlers

**Root Cause:**
```html
<!-- ❌ WRONG: Button inside clickable div with onclick -->
<div id="dropZone" onclick="fileInput.click()">
  <button onclick="fileInput.click()">Choose Files</button>
</div>
```

**Fix Applied:**
```html
<!-- ✅ CORRECT: Label with proper event handling -->
<div id="dropZone">
  <label for="fileInput" onclick="event.stopPropagation()">Choose Files</label>
  <input type="file" id="fileInput">
</div>
```

**Changes:**
1. Converted `<button>` to `<label for="fileInput">`
2. Added `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent bubbling
3. Removed duplicate `dropZone.addEventListener('click')` handler
4. Added `display: inline-block` styling for proper rendering

---

### **Issue #2: 405 Method Not Allowed on Upload**

**Problem:**
```
POST /documents/upload → 405 Method Not Allowed
```

**Root Cause:**
The `/documents/upload` endpoint **DID NOT EXIST**!

```python
# app/api/routes/documents.py - Only had GET endpoints:
@router.get("", ...)
@router.get("/{document_id}", ...)
# ❌ Missing: @router.post("/upload", ...)
```

**Fix Applied:**
Added complete POST upload endpoint in `app/api/routes/documents.py`:

```python
@router.post("/upload", summary="Upload and process a price document")
async def upload_document(
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    vendor_name: str = Form(...),
    processor: Optional[str] = Form(None),
    session: Session = Depends(get_db),
) -> dict:
    # 1. Auto-detect processor from file extension
    # 2. Save uploaded file to storage
    # 3. Create source document record
    # 4. Process file with appropriate processor
    # 5. Ingest offers via OfferIngestionService
    # 6. Return success or error
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-detects file type (.xlsx, .csv, .pdf, .jpg, .txt)
- ✅ Manual processor override available
- ✅ Saves files to configured storage directory
- ✅ Creates source document with metadata
- ✅ Processes file and ingests offers
- ✅ Returns detailed success/error messages
