## 🔄 Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1)
1. Upload initial vendor price sheets
2. Verify ingestion via operator UI
3. Test API endpoints with real queries
4. Set up monitoring (Railway dashboard)

### Week 1
5. Schedule recurring ingestion jobs
6. Import historical vendor data
7. Validate product deduplication accuracy
8. Monitor error rates and performance

### Week 2
9. Configure custom domain (optional)
10. Set up external monitoring (UptimeRobot)
11. Create data export scripts
12. Document operational procedures

## 💰 Estimated Costs

**Railway Monthly Costs:**
- Compute: $5/month (hobby tier)
- Postgres: $10/month (starter)
- Storage: $2.50/month (10GB)
- **Total: ~$17.50/month**

**Optional Add-ons:**
- OpenAI API: ~$20/month (if LLM enrichment enabled)
- Custom domain: $12/year

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

**Current Status:**
- ⚠️ No authentication on operator UI (add in Phase 2)
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default (Railway)
- ✅ Database not exposed to internet
- ✅ Secrets managed via environment variables
- ⚠️ No rate limiting (add in Phase 2)

**Phase 2 Security Roadmap:**
- Add HTTP Basic Auth to `/admin/*` routes
- Implement API key authentication
- Add rate limiting (1000 req/hour)
- Set up audit logging
- Configure CORS policies

---

## 📈 Success Criteria

### MVP Acceptance (Target: Oct 14)
- ✅ Production instance live on Railway
- ⬜ 500+ offers ingested from 10+ vendors
- ✅ Price history API returns real data
- ⬜ Operator UI secured with auth
- ✅ API documentation complete
- ✅ Test coverage ≥80%
- ⬜ Uptime >99% over 7 days

**Progress: 5/7 criteria met (71%)**

### Known Gaps to Address
1. Need to ingest more vendor data (only 37 offers currently)
2. Operator UI authentication not implemented
3. Production uptime not yet measured
